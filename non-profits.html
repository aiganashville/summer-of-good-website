            <h2 class="display-font light-blue-text">How about a Summer of Good for your organization?</h2>
            <p><strong>Facing communication challenges?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Uncertain how your non-profit is perceived by the community – or if that perception is accurate?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Preparing to launch a new initiative?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Need help getting the word out?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>If the answer to these is yes, AIGA Nashville’s Summer of Good is here to help!</strong></p>
            <p>This summer AIGA Nashville will pair design students with mentors (professional designers and agencies) to use design thinking, problem solving and design skills to solve challenges faced by non-profit organizations.</p>
            <p>This program is about more than just creating design or advertising work to solve immediate needs. While those short-term needs will be addressed, the broader goal of the program is for the AIGA design team to work in collaboration with non-profits to think beyond immediate needs and focus on the bigger picture and how to implement design solutions in order to reach long term goals. Therefore, the final results will include both short- term deliverables and long-term strategies.</p>
            <h3 class="display-font light-blue-text">What’s in it for you, the non-profit organization?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="light-blue-text">Short term deliverables</span> (for example: brochures, ads, logos, business cards, email templates, campaigns)</li>
              <li><span class="light-blue-text">Ideas and strategies</span> for long-term solutions (infrastructural changes, concepts, strategic plans for more robust campaigns, story boards, wire frames for web site development)</li>
              <li><span class="light-blue-text">Local and regional exposure</span> through AIGA events</li>
              <li><span class="light-blue-text">Possible national exposure</span> through the Design for Good initiative<br />(See Summer of Good and Design for Good sections below)</li>
              <li><span class="light-blue-text">Connections to leaders</span> in the design field</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="display-font light-blue-text">The Summer of Good & Design for Good</h3>
            <p><strong>The Summer of Good program is AIGA Nashville’s take on the national AIGA initiative called Design for Good.</strong></p>
            <p>Design for Good is a platform to build and sustain the implementation of design thinking for social change. The methodology commonly referred to as “design thinking” is a proven and repeatable problem-solving protocol that any business or profession can employ to achieve extraordinary results. The Design for Good platform creates opportunities for the organizations the designers work with to advance the organization’s mission, build their network and increase visibility. It allows the designers to build their practice, their network, and increase their visibility while creating a positive impact on the community. Design for Good aims to channel designers and their creative talent toward addressing community needs.</p>
            <p>The Summer of Good will forge relationships between the designers and non-profits that will enrich the future for the organization. AIGA will leverage the project to increase awareness in Nashville of the important and critical role design thinking can play in helping clients meet their larger objectives.</p>
