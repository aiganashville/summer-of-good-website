            <h2 class="display-font light-blue-text">Attention junior-level students!</h2>
            <p><strong>Do you think you have what it takes to be a part of AIGA Nashville’s Summer of Good internship program?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Why not spend the summer building your portfolio and giving a local non-profit the boost they need. Read the information below and apply!</strong></p>
            <h3 class="display-font light-blue-text">What is the Summer of Good?</h3>
            <p>This summer AIGA Nashville will pair design students with mentors (professional designers and agencies) to use design thinking, problem solving and design skills to solve challenges faced by select non-profit organizations.</p>
            <p>While participants will create design pieces during this process, the Summer of Good program is about more than just creating a piece of work for a non-profit. Participants will use all of their design thinking skills to work with the non-profit to move beyond what their immediate need is to focus on the bigger picture, achieving both short and long term goals, and proving the value of solid design thinking.</p>
            <h4><em>Still Interested???</em></p>
            <h3 class="display-font light-blue-text">Here’s the Skinny:</h3>
            <p>We are looking for <span class="light-blue-text">eight students</span> from the region to participate in the program. The program will run for eight weeks beginning <span class="light-blue-text">June 18 and lasting through August 10</span>, with final presentations during the week of August 18.</p>
            <p>The program will consist of <strong>roughly 150 working hours*</strong>, weekly meetings with a mentor and occasional meetings with the non-profit and AIGA facilitator. You will work to create design pieces, creative briefs and plans while documenting your progress.</p>
            <p><span class="light-blue-text">Work will be showcased at a final presentation celebration and displayed at this year’s Think Tank Conference.</span></p>
            <p><em>* Select schools will be able to offer internship credits for this program. Contact your internship coordinator or advisor and let them know you are applying.</em></p>
